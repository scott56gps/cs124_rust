* CS124 Rust
This repository is a collection of code projects, assignments and examples
from my BYU-Idaho CS124 class.  I am endeavoring to duplicate all of my work
from the class in Rust so I can better understand the language.  I also hope
to teach Rust to students someday as an introductory class.  I believe Rust
is a good first language to learn, because it helps you learn good coding
principles from the very start.  There is no "cout".  There is just print!
